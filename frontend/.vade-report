## Vercel Web Analytics Installation Complete

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js App Router project.

### Changes Made:

1. **Installed @vercel/analytics package**
   - Added `@vercel/analytics@^1.6.1` to dependencies
   - Updated `package-lock.json` with the new package and its dependencies

2. **Modified app/layout.tsx**
   - Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next'`
   - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the `<Toaster />` component
   - The Analytics component is properly nested within the ThemeProvider to ensure it has access to the app's context

3. **Updated tsconfig.json**
   - Next.js automatically updated the `jsx` setting from `react-jsx` to `preserve` for optimized JSX transform
   - This is a mandatory Next.js optimization that improves build performance

### Verification:

✅ **Build Test**: Successfully ran `npm run build` - production build completed without errors
✅ **Linting**: Next.js build process includes linting, which passed successfully
✅ **Type Checking**: TypeScript compilation succeeded with no type errors
✅ **Lock Files**: package-lock.json updated correctly with all new dependencies

### Implementation Details:

The `<Analytics />` component was placed inside the `<body>` tag as recommended by Vercel, after the main application content. This ensures:
- Analytics tracking is initialized on every page
- The component has access to the app's routing context
- Proper integration with Next.js App Router
- Minimal impact on page load performance

### Files Modified:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` - Next.js optimization applied

The implementation follows Next.js and Vercel best practices for App Router projects.
