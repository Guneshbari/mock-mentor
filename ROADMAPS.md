## How Roadmaps Work

### Adaptive Questioning

The AI uses your previous answers to:
1. **Adjust difficulty** - If you provide strong answers, follow-up questions go deeper
2. **Reference context** - Questions build upon your previous responses
3. **Focus on gaps** - If you miss key concepts, the next question may probe that area
4. **Stay relevant** - Questions align with your role and experience level

### Interview Structure

Each interview follows a **5-step progression**:

1. **Step 1** - Foundation concepts for the role
2. **Step 2** - Core skills and practical application
3. **Step 3** - Advanced techniques or scenarios
4. **Step 4** - Problem-solving and critical thinking
5. **Step 5** - Leadership, strategy, or meta-skills

### Question Types

Each interview type has different evaluation criteria:

**Technical:**
- Problem-solving ability
- Technical depth
- System understanding
- Best practices awareness

**HR:**
- Cultural fit
- Motivation and passion
- Career aspirations
- Communication style

**Behavioral:**
- STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
